# Regex Tutorial

This tutorial seeks to define a regular expression in programming contexts, 
commonly known as regex. A regex is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. 
When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain 
patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters 
within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.

## Summary

**/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/**

An example of a regex can be seen above. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be looking at a sequence 
of characters that can be used as a regex to search for most URLs, with the exception of some edge cases. The tutorial will break down 
the components of the "Matching a URL" regex to explore the regex components in general.
